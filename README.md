# Cybersecurity Portfolio by Imogene Bibbs
Welcome to my cybersecurity project portfolio. Each project simulates real-world tasks across domains like threat detection, network traffic analysis, log correlation, and cloud auditing. These hands-on builds highlight both technical skills and security mindset.
